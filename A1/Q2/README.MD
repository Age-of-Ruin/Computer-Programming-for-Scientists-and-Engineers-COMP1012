 1. To compute the function of R(x,t), the fraction of time it takes a radioactive element to flow past a predetermined point in space along a path where all elements move in the same direction (homogenous).
 
 2. Calculate properties of a sledge hammer (volume, mass and average density) and display these values using the print function to format output.
